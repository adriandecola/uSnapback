                Snapback primers enable genotyping with 2 unlabeled primers and a dsDNA dye. 
                No fluorescent labels or probes are necessary. A 5'-tail is added to one of the 
                primers that hybridizes to the variant site.
            </p>
            <p>
                uSnapback designs a snapback primer for genotyping of a single-base variant (SNV).
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                <strong>Enter sequence</strong> – Input or copy/paste the DNA sequence containing the 
                amplicon you want to amplify (A, C, G, T). Spaces, tabs, and new line breaks are OK.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Pick primers</strong> – Drag on the sequence to select the forward
                primer, then drag to select the reverse primer. The reverse primer must be
                to the right of the forward primer, and there must be at least 7 bases between
                them.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Choose the SNV</strong> – Click on the SNV, then choose
                the variant base. The SNV location cannot overlap a primer-binding site and must be
                at least 3 bases away from both primers.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>Target T<sub>m</sub></strong> – Enter the desired melting
                temperature for the wild-type snapback.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The results page will show the snapback primer and the limiting
                primer sequences (with copy buttons), the secondary structure of the extended snapback primer, and the predicted wild-type
                and variant T<sub>m</sub> values.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you need to change something, use Back to keep your inputs, or Restart to
                clear everything and start over.
